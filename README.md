# Try MMS Docker

This project is my learning notes towards learning `MXNet Model Server`.

It contains several runnable commands which I think make it easy for beginner like me to start learning (I'm not a fan of reading long / confusing documentation).

- `build` => used for generating model which will be used by the server then build the docker image
- `run` => used for running the built docker image
- `stop` => used for stopping the currently running docker image
- `test` => used for running sample inference (finding class of `kitten.jpg`)
